# pyogctest

`pyogctest` is a Python tool to run OGC test suites from your terminal. This is
done by using the REST API provided by
[Teamengine](http://opengeospatial.github.io/teamengine/#). Then the resulting
XML report is parsed and displayed to be humanly readable "Ã  la" `pytest` (as
much as possible).

```` python
$ git clone https://github.com/pblottiere/pyogctest
